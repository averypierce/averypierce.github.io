It was the night before halloween and I needed a costume. I sat in my dimly lit room, looked through my box of scraps from old projects, and came up with this-
an undershirt arc reactor for a low profile Tony Stark costume:

I didn't want to solder wires directly to batteries, so I used pennies as contact points.

Nothing fancy. Three LEDs wired together in series with no resistors. Lined with chrome duct tape to get more light out the front and hold everything together.
